# brish-brush

Quick app I made to try out react-cli. 
It will show how long you should spend brushing your teeth! I had to make it much shorter than the actual recommended amount of time because none of my friends have the required patience to reach brush properly...

## Install

From the folder above
```bash
$ npm install --global brish-brush
```

## Dev
```bash
$ npm run dev
```


## CLI

```
$ brish-brush --help

  Usage
    $ brish-brush
```
